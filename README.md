Haunted

> Did you know the original name of Pac-man was Puck-man? You would think it's because Pac-Man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the Japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed. They changed it over here because Puck-Man is too easy to vandalize. You know, scratch out the P and turn it into an F or whatever?

**Haunted** is a multiplayer, Pac-man like game that allows you to play against your friends, choose avatars, and game boards.
